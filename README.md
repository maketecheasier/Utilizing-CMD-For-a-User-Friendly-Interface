# Utilizing-CMD-For-a-User-Friendly-Interface
Here at MakeTechEasier, we are determined to make complicated things, some that require lots of experience, into something simple.
## Batch Files
Batch files use the .bat file extension and run commands on Command Prompt. The purpose of this repository is to make .bat files
that perform complicated commands, and turn them into something simple that anybody can understand.
## Utilizing the Batch Files
We are now attempting to turn the Batch files into something even easier to understand by making them into an application, allowing people
an easier interface to run them.
## Getting Started
It is fairly easy to understand. You download the Batch File that performs the command that you want, double-click on it and it will guide
you through complex operations with easy step-by-step instructions.
## Questions
For any questions, please create an issue in the Issues section of this repository. Feel free to help out and make some of your own, then 
upload them for others to use!
